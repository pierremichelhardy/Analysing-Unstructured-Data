# Analysing-Unstructured-Data
This code is in partial fulfillment of my final exam for my Smart Decision Support Systems class. Data used was confidential and cannot be shared. I cannot say much about the nature of the work but the context of the work is on online review platform's reviews and images. 

While this case did not have a specific business case, it still stands to exhibit my skill in analysing unstructured data. Among others, it showed proficiency in quantifying unstructured data like text and images (color histograms and line detection). 

The text was analyzed using a TF-IDF Matrix, polarity scores, and a logistic regression model. It was used to see the factors that affect a review's sentiment. 

Classification machine learning models were used on the images like SVM and Gradient Boosted Trees. The task was to classify an image and whether it depicts food, an indoor setting, or an outdoor setting. 

If one is interested to all the details, I have included my final exam named "SDSS Exam - Hardy PM - i6117019." The exam got a score of 8.22/10.
